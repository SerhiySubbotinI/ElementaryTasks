The Metod in Phyton is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Phyton Metods can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion,
manipulation, and deletion. Phyton Metod means a single unit of objects. Phyton Metod framework provides many
interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet,
TreeSet). The Metod interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework.
It declares the methods that every collection will have. In other words, we can say that the Metod interface
builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends. List interface is the child interface of Metod
interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. It can have
duplicate values.
To instantiate the List interface, we must use :
List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();
List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();
List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
There are various methods in List interface that can be used to insert, delete, and access the elements from the list.
